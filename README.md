### Facebook Ads Performance Weekly KPI Dashboard

This simulated FB ads performance dataset covers a period of three weeks. I used it to construct a weekly KPI dashboard. The dashboard compared the current week's performance to the last week's performance. 

On the left side, there are statistics for the current week and also the percentage of change compared to the last week. We can see that all figures are improved in the current week. But those improvements are at the expense of an even larger amount spent on advertisements. Navigate to the CPM indicator Chart. All the campaigns whose CPM is higher than $44 are marked in **RED**, which means the company can improve either the ad content or the landing page to lower the cost.

On the top right corner, it is the chart showing the number of the registered customer across three weeks. There is also a filter that enables us to filter out campaigns based on customer registration. Each bar of the CPM indicator chart and CTR indicator chart is clickable. It will dive into one campaign and show all the relevant details.

The dashboard is automatically updatable, as long as the data is correctly formatted and week filters are at the right time.
